CryptoTracker displays how the prices of various cryptocurrencies have changed throughout the past 30 days.

In order to use this app, you need to install all of the applications mentioned in the first line of this readme document.

To set up and use fbs, please refer to this website: https://www.learnpyqt.com/courses/packaging-and-distribution/packaging-pyqt5-apps-fbs/

Once you have set up fbs, you will notice that there is a directory called 'src' in the same directory as your virtual environment.
Go to 'src\main\python' and put all of the files here into that directory. The default main.py file should be replaced by the main.py file provided here.

You can run this software by activating virtual environment and then typing 'fbs run' in the virtual environment command line.
